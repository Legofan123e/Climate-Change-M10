# What is this?
Final Project of Kodland Python Pro Course.
# What's its objective?
Create a Discord Bot that provides a solution to the Climate Change, a global threat to life in Earth. Generally just has comands that give you information about the climate change, and ways to avoid it.
# Commands
- !info: Sends an info message about the bot itself
- !causes: Prints the causes of climate change
- !consequences: Prints the consequences of climate change
- !mitigation: Prints a message about mitigation methods for the climate change
- !fact: Currently prints one latitude level (I require assistance here!!)
- !weather: Shows the weather in a city. You can manually copy the weather of one city in a single day and then compare it to the weather of the same city in another day.
Any feedback would be appreciated!
